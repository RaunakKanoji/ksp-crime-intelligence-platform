# Feature 010: FIR Advanced Filters

## 1. Summary
Provide advanced filtering for FIR analysis. This feature is part of the `FIR Records` group and must be implemented only when it is the active feature. It helps the KSP Crime Intelligence web app support secure, explainable, and progressive crime intelligence workflows without turning the project into a multi-app or mobile implementation.

## 2. Problem
Current crime analysis workflows can be fragmented, manual, and dependent on spreadsheet-heavy processes. Without a focused fir advanced filters feature, users may lack a reliable way to perform this workflow with proper security, data context, permission controls, and auditability.

## 3. Users
- Investigators
- Crime analysts
- SCRB officials
- Admin users

## 4. Goals
- Deliver FIR Advanced Filters in a focused, maintainable way.
- Use the project's selected/default UI components only.
- Respect role-based access and sensitive data rules.
- Support loading, empty, error, and permission-restricted states.
- Support multi-select filters.
- Support date presets.
- Support location filters.
- Support legal section filters.

## 5. Non-Goals
- Do not implement unrelated features in the same pass.
- Do not create complex placeholder UI for inactive features.
- Do not introduce a new component library or design system.
- Do not expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.

## 6. User Stories
- As an investigator, I want to use fir advanced filters so that I can complete my crime-intelligence task without switching to manual spreadsheets.
- As a crime analyst, I want clear states and explanations so that I can understand whether data is unavailable, restricted, loading, or filtered out.
- As an admin/security reviewer, I want fir advanced filters to respect permissions and audit requirements so that sensitive crime data remains protected.

## 7. Functional Requirements
- Provide the core workflow for fir advanced filters exactly within the active feature scope.
- Support Multi-select filters.
- Support Date presets.
- Support Location filters.
- Support Legal section filters.
- Support Case status filters.
- Support Saved filter support.
- Support Reset filters.
- Support URL query sync if appropriate.
- Use real connected data only when the related data layer exists; otherwise use clearly labeled demo/sample data if demo mode is active.
- Handle loading, success, empty, validation-error, server-error, and permission-denied states.
- Keep implementation modular so it can be extended by later feature specs.

## 8. UI Requirements
- Use the default selected UI components for layout, cards, buttons, forms, tables, dialogs, and navigation.
- Keep the interface professional, serious, minimal, and police/intelligence-oriented.
- The page or component title should clearly read `FIR Advanced Filters`.
- Show clear labels, helper text, and safe empty states.
- Use tables for lists and structured sections for details.
- Restricted fields must show a permission-safe redacted state rather than hidden layout glitches.
- UI should account for multi-select filters.
- UI should account for date presets.
- UI should account for location filters.
- UI should account for legal section filters.
- UI should account for case status filters.

## 9. Data Requirements
- Use typed domain models and avoid unstructured `any` data.
- Record IDs should be stable and should not expose sensitive internals unnecessarily.
- All data returned to the UI must already be filtered by permission where sensitive.
- Requires FIR, Police Station, District, Crime Category, Act, Section, Case Status, Accused, Victim, and Incident data as applicable.
- Consider data needed for multi-select filters.
- Consider data needed for date presets.
- Consider data needed for location filters.
- Consider data needed for legal section filters.
- Consider data needed for case status filters.

## 10. API Requirements
- Do not implement API routes until this feature is the active implementation target.
- Document request/response types before implementation.
- Apply authentication, authorization, validation, and safe error handling server-side.
- Potential route: `GET /api/firs` or `GET /api/firs/:id` with permission-filtered fields.
- List endpoints should support pagination, filters, sorting, and search.

## 11. State Management
- Loading: show stable skeleton or loading message without shifting layout.
- Success: show authorized data and clear context for filters or data source.
- Empty: explain whether there are no records, no matching filters, or unavailable demo data.
- Error: show safe user-facing message without stack traces or sensitive details.
- Permission denied: show a restricted-access state and avoid fetching/rendering restricted data.
- Needs review: where AI/scoring/matching is involved, show human-review requirement.

## 12. Validation Rules
- Validate all required inputs before submission.
- Validate dates and ensure date ranges are logical.
- Validate IDs and enum values against known allowed values.
- Trim search text and reject unsafe or excessively long input.
- Apply server-side validation even if client-side validation exists.
- Validate inputs related to multi-select filters.
- Validate inputs related to date presets.
- Validate inputs related to location filters.

## 13. Security and Access Control
- Require authenticated access unless explicitly documented otherwise.
- Apply role-based permissions server-side.
- Redact or hide restricted fields based on user role.
- Log sensitive views or mutations where required.
- Do not expose raw sensitive data in client-side bundles, logs, URLs, or error messages.
- Victim, witness, accused, and investigation details require strict permission controls.

## 14. AI Behavior
- Not applicable.

## 15. Edge Cases
- User is authenticated but lacks permission.
- No records match active filters.
- Data exists but contains missing or inconsistent fields.
- Network/server request fails.
- Demo mode is enabled and data must be clearly labeled.

## 16. Acceptance Criteria
- A user with the correct permission can access fir advanced filters.
- A user without permission sees a safe restricted-access state.
- The feature uses only the selected/default UI component system.
- Loading, empty, error, and success states are handled.
- No unrelated features are implemented as part of this feature.
- Sensitive fields are redacted or hidden according to role permissions.
- Implementation updates the progress tracker when completed.
- The implementation supports multi-select filters.
- The implementation supports date presets.
- The implementation supports location filters.
- The implementation supports legal section filters.
- The implementation supports case status filters.
- Relevant sensitive actions create an audit log or document a pending audit integration if audit feature is not yet active.

## 17. Testing Notes
- Test authorized and unauthorized access.
- Test loading, empty, error, and success states.
- Test validation rules for all inputs and filters.
- Test that restricted fields are not returned from the server for unauthorized users.
- Perform a manual UI review for consistency with the selected component system.

## 18. Dependencies
- 008-fir-search
- 054-saved-queries

## 19. Implementation Notes

- Catalyst-first: Use Catalyst Data Store as the default data source, Catalyst Functions/AppSail server logic for calculations, and Catalyst Data Store OLAP/ZCQL for aggregate analytics where suitable. Store sensitive access audit logs in Catalyst Data Store.
- Implement FIR Advanced Filters in isolation after reading this spec and the main project docs.
- Keep route/page components thin and move domain logic into feature components or service utilities.
- Do not refactor unrelated files.
- Do not create production-looking placeholder data for inactive features.
- Update this spec if implementation decisions differ from the plan.
- Update `docs/progress-tracker.md` after meaningful changes.

## 20. Status
Initial status: Not Started.
